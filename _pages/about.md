I am a Jisc funded Data Science PhD student in the Big Scientific Data and Text Analytics Group (BSDTAG) at Knowledge Media Institute (KMi), Open University, UK. My research work focuses on identifying citation functions using automated methods for research evaluation. Specifically, I am interested in using Machine learning and Natural Language Processing to analyse scientific publications full-text for gaining insights about the discursive relationship between citing and cited articles.
